Description: Replication Rate (RR) is the probability of replicating a statistically significant association in genome-wide association studies. This R-package provide the estimation method for replication rate which makes use of the summary statistics from the primary study. We can use the estimated RR to determine the sample size of the replication study, and to check the consistency between the results of the primary study and those of the replication study.
